yet another unzip library for node. For zipping, see
[yazl](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yazl).

Design principles:

 * Follow the spec.
   Don't scan for local file headers.
   Read the central directory for file metadata.
   (see [No Streaming Unzip API](#no-streaming-unzip-api)).
 * Don't block the JavaScript thread.
   Use and provide async APIs.
 * Keep memory usage under control.
   Don't attempt to buffer entire files in RAM at once.
 * Never crash (if used properly).
   Don't let malformed zip files bring down client applications who are trying to catch errors.
 * Catch unsafe file names.
   See `validateFileName()`.

## Usage

```js
var yauzl = require("yauzl");

yauzl.open("path/to/file.zip", {lazyEntries: true}, function(err, zipfile) {
  if (err) throw err;
  zipfile.readEntry();
  zipfile.on("entry", function(entry) {
    if (/\/$/.test(entry.fileName)) {
      // Directory file names end with '/'.
      // Note that entires for directories themselves are optional.
      // An entry's fileName implicitly requires its parent directories to exist.
      zipfile.readEntry();
    } else {
      // file entry
      zipfile.openReadStream(entry, function(err, readStream) {
        if (err) throw err;
        readStream.on("end", function() {
          zipfile.readEntry();
        });
        readStream.pipe(somewhere);
      });
    }
  });
});
```

## API

The default for every optional `callback` parameter is:

```js
function defaultCallback(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
}
```

### open(path, [options], [callback])

Calls `fs.open(path, "r")` and reads the `fd` effectively the same as `fromFd()` would.

`options` may be omitted or `null`. The defaults are `{autoClose: true, lazyEntries: false, decodeStrings: true, validateEntrySizes: true, strictFileNames: false}`.

`autoClose` is effectively equivalent to:

```js
zipfile.once("end", function() {
  zipfile.close();
});
```

`lazyEntries` indicates that entries should be read only when `readEntry()` is called.
If `lazyEntries` is `false`, `entry` events will be emitted as fast as possible to allow `pipe()`ing
file data from all entries in parallel.
This is not recommended, as it can lead to out of control memory usage for zip files with many entries.
See [issue #22](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yauzl/issues/22).
If `lazyEntries` is `true`, an `entry` or `end` event will be emitted in response to each call to `readEntry()`.
This allows processing of one entry at a time, and will keep memory usage under control for zip files with many entries.

`decodeStrings` is the default and causes yauzl to decode strings with `CP437` or `UTF-8` as required by the spec.
The exact effects of turning this option off are:

* `zipfile.comment`, `entry.fileName`, and `entry.fileComment` will be `Buffer` objects instead of `String`s.
* Any Info-ZIP Unicode Path Extra Field will be ignored. See `extraFields`.
* Automatic file name validation will not be performed. See `validateFileName()`.

`validateEntrySizes` is the default and ensures that an entry's reported uncompressed size matches its actual uncompressed size.
This check happens as early as possible, which is either before emitting each `"entry"` event (for entries with no compression),
or during the `readStream` piping after calling `openReadStream()`.
See `openReadStream()` for more information on defending against zip bomb attacks.

When `strictFileNames` is `false` (the default) and `decodeStrings` is `true`,
all backslash (`\`) characters in each `entry.fileName` are replaced with forward slashes (`/`).
The spec forbids file names with backslashes,
but Microsoft's `System.IO.Compression.ZipFile` class in .NET versions 4.5.0 until 4.6.1
creates non-conformant zipfiles with backslashes in file names.
`strictFileNames` is `false` by default so that clients can read these
non-conformant zipfiles without knowing about this Microsoft-specific bug.
When `strictFileNames` is `true` and `decodeStrings` is `true`,
entries with backslashes in their file names will result in an error. See `validateFileName()`.
When `decodeStrings` is `false`, `strictFileNames` has no effect.

The `callback` is given the arguments `(err, zipfile)`.
An `err` is provided if the End of Central Directory Record cannot be found, or if its metadata appears malformed.
This kind of error usually indicates that this is not a zip file.
Otherwise, `zipfile` is an instance of `ZipFile`.

### fromFd(fd, [options], [callback])

Reads from the fd, which is presumed to be an open .zip file.
Note that random access is required by the zip file specification,
so the fd
